    <p> The Half Life Trilogy </p>
    <p> The Half Life Trilogy is near of of the best trilogys ever, in mankind, in lifekind, it currently has 7 games in it, 3 for goldsource and 3 for Source and 1 for source 2, the most recent game, Half Life Alyx came out of nowhere and a giant shock around the globe as the once thought dead series of a game, Half Life, would never get another game, but it was not Half Life 3, it was still a half life game, and god almight and everything holy, it. held. upto. expections. The game was nicely decorated, looked nice, played well and might start a cataclamisc switch over from desktop games to high quality VR games, as other games in there series brought live physics and every game you turn into has physics now, and they where one of the first, so I would not be suprised if a giant influx of VR games starts to pour into the market. Im not going to spoil any details about the story here but I will recomend playing HL2 First BEFORE HL1 if your new to PC gaming, because its more modern, less clunky and will get you into the series, It happens after the Black Mesa Accident and you take the shoes of Gordon Freeman, and you step off a train into City 17. Its a game I never thought would summon a spinoff mod that makes it into a sandbox and then contune to drain over 3k hours of my life into that game. It really says alot about the community, after so much time of no half life games, we have gotten fan projects, failed, and still in the works, and the modders and mappers contuing working on this game despite its age. Theres so much I want to say about this game but I cant due to how long I have gone on, but in my final words, this trilogy is one of the best, and I cant wait for the future of the Half Life Universe and the expasion on plot or story, or even just more gameplay, Half Life Citadell, a new game, is belived to be in the works, and I cant wait for it</p>

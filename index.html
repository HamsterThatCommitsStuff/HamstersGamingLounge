    <p> Welcome to City 17! You have chosen, or been chosen, to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers. I thought so much of City 17 that I elected to establish my administration here, in the Citadel so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors. I've been proud to call City 17 my home.</p>

    <h2> THe History Of Hamsters <sub>gaming</sub> <sup>Website</sup> </h2>
    <p> Hamsters Gaming Website started as a project commisoned by The Table of Nolandia, a group of friends that sat at a table, after moving onto other projects I turned back to this project and turned it around into my own website and now it is being made fully into my website with proper formating and its currently in a "beta" stage, its not finished, and will most likely never finish. Its a very big project im undertaking so I might get burnt out and head to other projects while I recharge, I have a life so dont expect games to be added enmass everyday, i will *try* to make a update system with an announcment and all.</p>

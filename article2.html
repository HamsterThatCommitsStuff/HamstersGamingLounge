    <p> why ChromeOS Sucks</p>
    <p> ChromeOS, where do I start with this thing, Take your chrome browser, then try to use that exclusivly, with no files, boom there you have it, a memory sucking os that has to have LINUX intagrated into it so it isent so limited, and even then it sucks, not even able to play minecraft at a Stable 30 FPS, (thanks arma for teaching me 30FPS is playable), and to add onto that, without linux, tou cant open .exe, or really any .filetype, If your getting a chromebook, ditch it, and get a PC or a decent Windows Laptop</p>
